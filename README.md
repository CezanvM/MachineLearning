Machine-learning assignment 
This was a project during our second period of our 4th year of Computer Science at Avans. This project was our final assignment for the Machine Learning course we followed. In this project we will analyze the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps

The goal of our project is to estimate the star rating according to certain features like price, category etc.
After this goal has been reached the next aim will be to determine the optimal combination of features for the highest possible score.
